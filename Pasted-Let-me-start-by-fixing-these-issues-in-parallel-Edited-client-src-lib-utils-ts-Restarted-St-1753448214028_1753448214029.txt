Now I need to fix the static file serving to properly handle TypeScript modules. Let me also add proper MIME type configuration for tsx and .ts files:

The static file serving issue is complex since we need proper TypeScript/JSX compilation. In development mode, we should be using a proper dev server that can handle TypeScript modules. Let me start the frontend dev server separately while keeping the backend API running.
Since the current setup is serving raw TypeScript files that browsers can't execute, I need to either:
1.    Set up proper Vite dev server integration, or
2.    Use a simpler approach with pre-built assets
Let me check what's in the client directory and set up a proper build process:

I can see the main issue now - there's a critical React import error. The browser console shows "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: React",

The issue might be that we need to use the automatic runtime for React 17+ JSX transform. Let me try creating a React entry point that explicitly makes React available globally.

Based on the detailed mission document you've provided, I can see you're working on the YMERA Enterprise Platform Phase 3 Integration & AI Agents Mission. Let me summarize the objective and create a comprehensive plan.
Project Objective Summary
You're building a unified YMERA Enterprise Platform that needs to:
1. Fix critical issues in the existing Phase 1-2 deployment (React import errors, CSP violations, TypeScript issues)
2. Create a unified interface with professional dashboard and logo integration
3. Integrate Phase 3 AI Agents System into the existing FastAPI-based platform
4. Ensure all components work together with proper validation and testing
The platform currently has deployment issues preventing proper functionality of the dashboard, API documentation, and health check endpoints.
I uploaded all files of phase 1 & 2 and attached is the logo
1 hour ago
MO

Perfect! I can see you've uploaded the Phase 1-2 files and provided the beautiful Ymera logo with its animated design. The logo has a sophisticated gradient design with an infinity symbol animation and "by Mohamed Mansour" subtitle - this will integrate beautifully into the unified dashboard.
Now I have all the context needed to proceed with the mission. The plan I proposed covers exactly what you need:
Current Status
* Phase 1-2: Files uploaded with known React/TypeScript/CSP issues
* Logo: Beautiful animated Ymera logo with gradient colors and infinity symbol
* Mission: Fix existing issues → Create unified interface → Integrate Phase 3 AI Agents

Next Steps
The plan addresses your exact requirements:
2. Stage 1: Apply the immediate fixes for React imports, CSP policies, route ordering, and dependencies
4. Stage 2: Validate all endpoints work properly (health check, API docs, dashboard)
6. Stage 3: Create the unified interface incorporating your Ymera logo design
8. Stage 4: Integrate the Phase 3 AI Agents system
The logo's gradient color scheme (gold #FBBF24, blue #2563EB, red #991B1B) will be perfectly integrated into the professional dashboard design with the backdrop blur effects and modern styling.
Ready to Execute
The plan is comprehensive and addresses all the critical fixes mentioned in your mission document. It follows the exact staged approach you outlined:
* ✅ Fix known issues first (React imports, CSP, TypeScript)
* ✅ Validate Phase 1-2 functionality
* ✅ Create unified interface with logo integration
* ✅ Integrate Phase 3 AI Agents
Would you like me to proceed by clicking "Approve plan & start" to begin implementing the fixes and building the unified YMERA Enterprise Platform with your logo integrated into the dashboard?

Let me restart the server to apply the CORS changes and then check if there's a fundamental issue with the server-client connection. The server might be running but not properly handling HTTP requests.

Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. The Hono CORS middleware is causing a compatibility problem with the Node.js HTTP server. The error
this. raw.headers.get is not a function indicates that Hono's request handling isn't compatible with Node.js's native HTTP request objects.
Let me fix this by removing the problematic CORS middleware and using a simpler approach that works with the Node.js server setup.

Excellent! Now I can see progress in the logs - there's a GET / request being logged, which means the server is now properly handling HTTP requests. The CORS issue has been resolved. Let me test if the health endpoint is working now:

I'm analyzing why the server is still unreachable despite being properly configured and running. The logs show the server is initialized and handling requests, but there seems to be a connection issue.

can see the YMERA Enterprise Platform server is running on port 5000 with all services initialized (WebSocket, API endpoints, dashboard), but there's a connection issue preventing external access. The server logs show it's handling requests internally, but the web interface isn't accessible from outside.
This appears to be a Replit-specific networking issue where the internal port 5000 isn't properly mapped to the external port 80. Should I try a different approach to fix the port mapping, or would you prefer me to switch to a simpler server setup that's more compatible with Replit's environment?
