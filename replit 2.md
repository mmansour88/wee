# YMERA Enterprise Platform

## Overview

YMERA is an enterprise-grade platform built with a hybrid Python/TypeScript architecture. The system features an intelligent agent management system with integrated learning capabilities, real-time collaboration, and comprehensive security measures. The platform uses FastAPI for the backend with SQLAlchemy ORM, React/TypeScript for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async/await pattern for high performance
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async sessions for database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with plans for migration management via Drizzle
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and performance optimization
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token support
- **Middleware Stack**: Comprehensive middleware for CORS, rate limiting, logging, error handling, and security

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with async connections
- **ORM Strategy**: Dual approach using both SQLAlchemy (Python) and Drizzle (TypeScript)
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic for Python migrations, Drizzle for TypeScript migrations
- **Connection Pooling**: Configurable connection pools with health monitoring

## Key Components

### Authentication & Security
- JWT token-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Comprehensive middleware stack for request validation and security
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Input validation and sanitization at multiple layers
- Encryption utilities for sensitive data protection

### Agent Management System
- Intelligent agent lifecycle management
- Agent learning and knowledge retention capabilities
- Inter-agent communication and collaboration tracking
- Performance metrics and behavioral pattern analysis
- Knowledge graph integration for learning relationships

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket support for real-time collaboration
- Message encryption for secure communications
- Connection management with automatic reconnection
- Rate limiting and performance monitoring

### File Management
- Secure file upload and processing
- Metadata extraction and storage
- Version control and access management
- Content analysis and quality scoring
- Integration with agent learning systems

### Project Management
- Comprehensive project lifecycle management
- Task tracking and dependency management
- Resource allocation and budget monitoring
- Team collaboration features
- Progress tracking and reporting

## Data Flow

1. **Request Processing**: All requests flow through the middleware stack (CORS → Auth → Rate Limiting → Logging → Security → Error Handling)
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens are validated and user context is established
3. **Business Logic**: Requests are routed to appropriate handlers with database operations
4. **Agent Integration**: Actions trigger agent learning updates and knowledge synchronization
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections broadcast relevant updates to connected clients
6. **Response**: Responses are formatted and returned through the middleware chain

## External Dependencies

### Python Dependencies
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Gunicorn for production deployment
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, psycopg2 for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **Authentication**: python-jose, passlib, bcrypt for security
- **Caching**: aioredis for Redis integration
- **Monitoring**: structlog for structured logging
- **Testing**: pytest with async and coverage plugins

### Node.js Dependencies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite for development environment
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with utility-first approach
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server synchronization

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless in development)
- **Cache**: Redis for session storage and performance
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with plans for cloud storage
- **Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking and metrics collection

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Replit-based development with hot reload
- SQLite/PostgreSQL for local development
- Environment-based configuration management
- Automated testing with pytest and coverage reporting

### Production Considerations
- Gunicorn with async workers for Python backend
- Nginx reverse proxy for static file serving and load balancing
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling and monitoring
- Redis cluster for high availability caching
- Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- Environment variable configuration for security and flexibility

### Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection and tracking
- Error tracking and alerting systems
- Database query monitoring and optimization
- Real-time system health dashboards
